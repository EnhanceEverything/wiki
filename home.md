# Enhance Everything Wiki

Welcome to our wiki. We have information mostly focused around image and video upscaling using neural networks (ESRGAN in particular).

## About Us

- If you have any questions, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cpAUpDK) where you can ask them. We also have a dedicated channel for model releases here.
- We also have a [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameUpscale/).

## The Model Database

We have moved our models to a new dedicated [model database page called OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/).

## Apply Super Resolution Models

### Tools and GUIs

- [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer) this is the recommended way to run most models on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Train Your own Models

- [Training Guide](/training-guide)

This guide walks you through the basics of training your own model.

- [Training Tools](/training-tools)

This is a list of tools to train and various tools useful while training.

## Useful Information

- [Terminology](/terminology)
Useful to know to be able to understand what people are talking about in discussions, papers, ...

## Other resources, blogs and links

- [Pixelate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelate/ffmgnhmbppbhmhnehfjelgnbcbaehofe/related?hl=en-GB)
is a Chrome plugin that disables the bicubic filtering for upscaled images. Useful especially when zooming in pixel art.

- [No More Pixels](https://nomorepixels.tumblr.com/)
An image gallery showcasing the possibilities of retro pixel art upscaled using ESRGAN.
